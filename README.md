# Decky Gog

This is a [decky](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader) plugin for managing Gog games.


## usage

- [Get decky setup](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader#installation)
- extract [plugin]() in `~/homebrew/plugins`
- open plugin in decky sidebar

## TODO

- Look into [better database](https://api-docs.igdb.com/)
- Look into adding other types of games
- Help steam-rom-manager support stemdeck better
- Look into adding data directly to gog-galaxy database (so all the other code can share data with windows gog galaxy)
